<hr/>

<h3>Marked for Death</h3>

Only reason this is a favorite of mines is because I use to watch it all the time with family

<h3>Dont be a Menace</h3>

I watched this movie alot and still havent seen all the hidden messages in the movie.

<h3>Dragonball Z</h3>

It's really an anime but its one of my favs and I grew up on it.
